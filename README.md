# MongoSocial
Social media backend using Mongoose 

This app allows for a creating and modification of users and thoughts for a social media platform. I have created routes to allow a user to be created, modified and deleted. Friends can be added to a users account as well as deleted. Their posts "thoughts" work in a similar way as they can be added, modified and deleted but can also be replied (reacted) to. Reactions are contained in a schema within the thought model.
